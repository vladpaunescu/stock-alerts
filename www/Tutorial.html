<h2 class="subtitle">History</h2>
                                    <p><span class="tab1"></span>Stock markets did not begin as the super-sophisticated, simultaneous, 
									worldwide trading exchanges of today. It was not until 1531 when the first 
									institution roughly approximating a stock market emerged, in Antwerp, Belgium. 
									However, as Investopedia notes, this was, “…the first stock market, sans stock.” 
									Rather than buying and selling shares of companies (which did not yet exist), 
									brokers and lenders congregated there to “deal in business, government and even individual debt issues.”
									<br> </br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>This changed in the 1600's, when Britain, France, and the Netherlands all chartered voyages to the East Indies. 
									Realizing that few explorers could afford conducting an overseas trade voyage, limited liability companies were 
									formed to raise money from investors, who received a share of profits commensurate with their investment.
									<br> </br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>This form of business organization was also necessitated by risk management. As India’s Imperial Gazetteer reports, 
									the earliest British voyages to the Indian Ocean were unsuccessful, resulting in lost ships and the financier’s personal 
									fortunes being seized by creditors. This led a group of London merchants to form a corporation in September of 1599 which 
									would limit each member’s liability to the amount they personally invested. If the voyage failed, nothing more than this 
									amount could be lawfully seized. The Queen granted the merchants a fifteen year charter in 1600, dubbing their corporation 
									the “Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East Indies” (or simply, “The East India Company.”) The 
									limited liability formula proved successful, leading King James I to grant charters to more trading companies by 1609 and 
									triggering business growth in other ocean-bordering European countries.
									<br> </br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>The Dutch East India company was actually the first to allow outside investors to purchase shares entitling them to a fixed 
									percentage of the company’s profits. They were also the first company to issue stocks and bonds to the general public, doing 
									so via the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in 1602 according to Britannica.
									</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Elementary notions about Stocks</h2>
									<p>
									<strong>Stock markets.</strong> Stock is a printed paper issued by a company to attract investments, money. 
									Usually with dividends. [NYSE (New York Stock Exchange), NASDAQ (National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation), 
									EUSDAQ, London Stock Exchange, et al.]
									<br></br>
									<strong>Bond markets.</strong> “Bond : a printed paper given by a government, city or business
									company saying that money has been received and and will be paid back, usually with interest,” which is fixed.
									<br></br>
									<strong>Currency markets or foreign exchange markets.</strong>
									<br></br>
									<strong>Commodity markets</strong> (oil, gold, copper, wheat, electricity, etc).
									<br></br>
									<strong>Futures and options markets.</strong> ”Futures: goods and stocks bought at prices
									agreed upon at the time of the purchase but paid for and delivered afterwards.”
									”Option : the right to buy or sell something at a certain price within a certain
									period of time.” [CBOE (Chicago Board Option Exchange).
									<br></br>
									<br></br>
									</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">How To Play The Stock Market</h2>
									<p>
									<span class="tab1"></span>When investing in the stock market it is a good idea to diversify and have your money in a lot of different stocks. 
									This is a fine idea because you do not want to have everything in one stock and lose it all. It is also a good idea because 
									when you lose from one stock, it can be evened out by gains from another.
									A great tip that most investors could use is to make a rule where you automatically sell off your stocks if they go down in value by about 8% of the original stock 
									price. Lots of times’ stockholders are praying for a rebound that never comes, and they end up losing even more money.
									<br></br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>When it comes to purchasing shares, there are two distinct types to choose from: preferred shares and common shares. There is a greater risk factor of losing money 
									with investing in common shares if the company you own shares in goes out of business. The reason for this is that bond holders, creditors and those who own preferred 
									stocks will be first in line to regain some of their money from a company that stops functioning since they have a higher ranking than a common shareholder.
									When buying and selling stock, be sure to buy low and sell high. Don’t be fooled into buying stocks that are high in price due to a popularity rise, or deterred from 
									buying stocks that are low in price due to a lack of popularity. Buying low means you get better value, and selling high means you get better profits.
									<br></br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>Avoid media programming that covers the stock market, from radio broadcasts to financial news networks. These outlets are great for tracking moment to moment 
									happenings and near future fluctuations, but you want to pay attention to a generation from now. Letting in short term market gyrations into your mind,
									will only erode your confidence and composure.
									Never rely on hearsay, as following the crowd is often a recipe for disaster. When everyone buys the same stocks, the value will decrease and less people are going
									to buy it in the future. Think independently and do your own research, instead of solely depending on what others say.
									<br></br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>When considering a certain company, think about if you’d like to own the entire company. The businesses that have the best
									reputations and the most availability as far as purchasing their products or services are the most likely to do well in the stock market. 
									Keep this in mind when selecting stocks.
									Don’t make your investment decisions based on one loss. The reality of the stock market is that you will lose money sometimes. If you decide to sell every time a 
									loss comes about, you will never give yourself a chance to make a profit. If instead, you do some research and make some educated decisions about when it is time 
									to get out, and when it is time to stay in, you will see that some stocks come back, and they might even come back strong.
									<br></br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>When starting out in the stock market, your best bet is to invest in a few high quality and popular stocks. You don’t need to 
									include 20 or 30 different stocks in your portfolio. Rather, start to get a feel of how the market works by only selecting a few promising options at one time.
									Be sensitive to the paradox of stock market history. History clearly demonstrates that those who buy good stocks and hold them, do better than those who trade frequently.
									<br></br>
									<span class="tab1"></span>However, individual stock histories are not absolutely sure to follow in the future, and while the market averages 10% annual returns, it does not do 10% every year.
									Learning how to invest some money in the stock market can be a great way to supplement any income. Profits from investments can provide savings for a rainy day fund, 
									or a consistent way to make money. Remember the tips in this article, so that you can start using the stock market today!
